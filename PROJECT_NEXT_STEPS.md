# EduTube Project - Next Steps

This guide provides a roadmap for continuing the development of your EduTube project. We've resolved the initial setup issues with the backend, and now you can focus on implementing core features.

## 1. Backend Development

### Fix Database Connection
- Follow the instructions in `POSTGRES_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to properly set up your Supabase PostgreSQL connection
- If you can't resolve the connection issues, proceed with SQLite for now and migrate later

### Complete Models and API Endpoints
- Finish implementing the remaining models and API endpoints for:
  - User authentication & profile management
  - Course search, enrollment, and progress tracking
  - Quiz generation and attempt submission
  - Certificate creation and verification
  - NFT minting integration

### API Testing
- Use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Implement validation and error handling

## 2. Frontend Development

### Complete UI Components
- Finish implementing the UI components according to the design
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Implement loading states and error handling

### Integrate with Backend APIs
- Connect all frontend components to their corresponding backend APIs
- Set up authentication flow with Firebase
- Implement state management (Context API or Redux if needed)

### YouTube Integration
- Finish the YouTube player component with proper event handling
- Implement the search functionality using the YouTube API
- Add playlist support for course navigation

## 3. Quiz and Certificate System

### Quiz Generation
- Implement the OpenAI integration for quiz generation
- Add support for different difficulty levels
- Create the quiz-taking UI with anti-cheat measures

### Certificate System
- Design the certificate template
- Implement PDF generation
- Add blockchain validation using ThirdWeb

## 4. Deployment Preparation

### Environment Configuration
- Separate development and production environment variables
- Set up proper CI/CD pipelines

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Reduce bundle sizes

### Security Measures
- Audit code for security vulnerabilities
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Set up CORS, CSP, and other security headers

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### User Testing
- Conduct user testing sessions
- Gather feedback and implement improvements

### Cross-browser Testing
- Ensure the application works on all major browsers
- Check mobile responsiveness

### Load Testing
- Test the system under high load conditions
- Identify and fix bottlenecks

## 6. Documentation

### API Documentation
- Document all API endpoints using Swagger or similar tools

### User Documentation
- Create help guides for users
- Add tooltips and onboarding flows

### Developer Documentation
- Document the codebase structure
- Add setup instructions for new developers

## Immediate Next Tasks

1. Run and test the current functionality with SQLite
2. Add the missing API endpoints for course enrollment
3. Implement the quiz generation feature 
4. Set up the certificate generation system
5. Connect the frontend to the backend APIs

By following this roadmap, you'll be able to systematically develop the EduTube platform with all the features described in your project plan.
