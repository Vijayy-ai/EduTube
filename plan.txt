Project Overview
Concept:
Create a platform where users can gain verifiable certificates for learning from YouTube courses/playlists. use YouTube Data API v3 so that users can search and watch YouTube se videos, playlists, then watch the content via an embedded player (using the YouTube IFrame API), after succufully complete the video and playlist then take a 20-question quiz (with questions generated or curated via the OpenAI API based on the video or playlist that has been watched by the users means videos ke title discription and even usake subtitile ka use karke isake liye tumko proper data send karna he open ai ko videos ka proper ok then fir vo basic se intermidet and advance 10 or 20 quize ke questions generate karega then users ko test pass karna padega then). Upon successful completion, the system generates a certificate PDF, mints an NFT certificate (using ThirdWeb’s free NFT minter), and stores the certificate on decentralized storage (IPFS). The certificate’s IPFS link/hash is then recorded on the EduChain/Polygon blockchain for validation. 

User Benefits:

Validated certificates for free YouTube courses
Transparent, tamper-proof record of achievements
Personal dashboard to track courses, quiz scores, and rankings
2. Tech Stack
Frontend:

Framework: React.js and backend as django python ok 
YouTube Integration: YouTube IFrame API and YouTube Data API v3
Wallet & Blockchain Integration: WalletConnect/Web3Modal, ThirdWeb SDK
Backend & User Management:

Firebase: Authentication, real-time database, user profile storage
Quiz & Content Processing:

OpenAI API: For generating quiz questions (basic, intermediate, advanced) from video transcripts or summaries
Certificate Generation & Blockchain:

PDFKit.js: To generate certificate PDFs
ThirdWeb NFT Minter: For demo NFT minting (free setup within ~5 minutes)
IPFS: For storing certificate PDFs (store the PDF, then record the IPFS hash/link)
Blockchain: EduChain/Polygon – to record certificate metadata (IPFS hash, user details)
Anti-Cheat Measures:

JavaScript Page Visibility API: To detect tab switching or focus loss
Browser Event Handlers: To disable context menu, monitor full-screen mode, and detect suspicious behaviors
3. Modules & Implementation Details
A. User Management & Authentication
Firebase Setup:
Configure Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google sign-in, etc.)
Create a user profile collection in Firebase Firestore to track enrolled courses, quiz results, and certificate status
B. Course Integration
YouTube IFrame API:
Embed YouTube videos/playlists within your platform
Fetch and display video details (title, description, thumbnail)
then extract video transcripts (using a library like “youtube-transcript-api”) for quiz generation
C. Quiz Module
Quiz Generation:
Use the OpenAI API to process the video transcript or metadata to generate 20 questions (categorized as basic, intermediate, and advanced)
Quiz Interface:
Develop a responsive quiz interface that presents questions sequentially
Implement answer validation and scoring logic
Anti-Cheat Measures:
Integrate the Page Visibility API to detect when the user navigates away from the quiz page
Disable right-click and keyboard shortcuts that may allow copy/paste or external resource access
Optionally enforce a full-screen mode during the quiz to minimize cheating attempts
D. Certificate Generation & Blockchain Integration
Certificate PDF Generation:
Use PDFKit.js to generate a certificate PDF that includes user name, course title, completion date, and unique certificate ID
NFT Minting with ThirdWeb:
Integrate ThirdWeb’s free NFT minter to mint an NFT certificate as a digital asset
Connect the user’s wallet (via WalletConnect or similar) to facilitate blockchain transactions
Decentralized Storage with IPFS:
Upload the generated certificate PDF to IPFS
Retrieve the IPFS link/hash after upload
Blockchain Recording:
Save the IPFS hash along with certificate metadata on the EduChain/Polygon blockchain. This can be achieved by calling a smart contract function that stores the certificate details (using libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js)
E. User Dashboard & Progress Tracking
Dashboard Development:
Develop a dashboard where users can view:
Enrolled courses and progress
Quiz scores and certificate status
A universal ranking/progress system based on course completions and NFT certificates
Data Integration:
Use Firebase to sync user progress data and display leaderboard statistics, rankings, and completed courses


so we need to build this project asap so let's start exicute the commands and setup the project react js and django apps proper and then continue the developemt for this project as we have metioned that what to build ok
